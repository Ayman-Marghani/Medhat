Ideas:
-Give the user the whole database if he wants? [asks what diseases are in your database?]

-Add patterns to chatbot for (Treatments, causes): 
    I want to know the treatments of [d]
    I want to know the causes of [d]

-Add pattern of "I want to know more about [disease]" -> description?  -> done
    

-What are the symptoms of [disease] -> pattern : Results in all related symptoms. -> done
    "I have the third symptom"

-Search for a [symptom-disease] -> Implicit use only probably [in "i did not recognize symptom"]: -> done
    helps the user pinpoint his symptom
    LIKE in database query (another approach)

-Help menu:
    Shows all functionality and how to access it : [To search -> "search for [_]" , To ask about a disease -> "what is [disease]] -> done
