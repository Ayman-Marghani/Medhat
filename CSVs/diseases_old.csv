1,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling in the aorta, the artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (abdomen). Most aneurysms do not cause any problems, but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture).","medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger
surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful
","An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened.
It's not always clear what causes it, but some people have a higher chance of getting one.
You’re more at risk if you:
are male and aged 65 or over
smoke or used to smoke
have high blood pressure
have high cholesterol
have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm
have coronary or peripheral artery disease (atherosclerosis)
have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
have a condition such as Marfan syndrome
Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection, but this is rare.",Severe,Vascular Surgeon,Common,No
2,Achalasia,"Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus), which can make it difficult to swallow food and drink.","There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier.
Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.
Medicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine, can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone.
The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time.
Under a sedative or general anaesthetic, a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube (endoscope). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach.
This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.
Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery.
Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax.
It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.
Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and is called Heller's Myotomy.
It can permanently make swallowing easier.
Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn, which can be a side effect of the Heller's Myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this.
In rare cases some people may need an operation to remove part of their oesophagus.
Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely.
It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. Drinking cold water may help relieve this.
You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.
","Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly, which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown.
In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs.
In rare cases, achalasia may run in families.",Moderate,Gastroenterologist,Rare,No
3,Acne,"Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch.",,"Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.
Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).
This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.
The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.
Other possible causes
Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.
Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.
There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.",Mild,Dermatologist,Common,No
4,Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma),An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma.,"monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger
brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger
stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger
",,Moderate,Neurotologist,Rare,No
5,Acromegaly,"Acromegaly is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone, causing body tissues and bones to grow more quickly.","reduce growth hormone production to normal levels

improve your symptoms
damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland
leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain
meningitis – although this is rare
a monthly injection of either octreotide, lanreotide or pasireotide – this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours
a daily pegvisomant injection – this blocks the effects of growth hormone and can significantly improve symptoms
bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets – these can stop growth hormone being produced, but they only work in a small proportion of people
stereotactic radiotherapy – a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you'll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session
conventional radiotherapy – this also uses a beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it's wider and less precise than the one used in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it's given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to give your tissues time to heal between treatments
","If you do not get treatment, you may be at risk of developing:
type 2 diabetes
high blood pressure (hypertension)
heart disease
disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
arthritis
bowel polyps, which can potentially turn into bowel cancer if left untreated
Because of the risk of bowel polyps, a procedure known as a colonoscopy might be recommended if you've been diagnosed with acromegaly. Regular colonoscopy screening may also be necessary.",Severe,Endocrinologist,Rare,No
6,Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses),"Actinic keratoses (also called solar keratoses) are dry, scaly patches of skin that have been damaged by the sun. It's not usually serious, but there's a small chance the patches could become skin cancer. Protecting your skin in the sun and watching out for changes can help.","prescription creams and gels
freezing the patches (cryotherapy) – this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks
surgery to cut out or scrape away the patches – you'll be given a local anaesthetic first, so it does not hurt

7,Acute cholecystitis,Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct.,"not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder
receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration
taking medicine to relieve your pain
open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy
laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen
","The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.
Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.
Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge.
Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals.
The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis.
The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.
A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, sepsis, severe malnutrition or dehydration.",Moderate,Gastroenterologist,Common,No
8,Acute kidney injury,Acute kidney injury (AKI) is where your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure.,"to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated
antibiotics if you have an infection
to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted)
a urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage
","You're more likely to get AKI if:
you're aged 65 or over
you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease
you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure, liver disease or diabetes
you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently
you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this)
you have a severe infection or sepsis
you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness
you're given aminoglycosides – a type of antibiotic that's usually only given in hospital; these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill",Severe,Nephrologist,Common,No
9,Acute myeloid leukaemia,"Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses quickly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment.","Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible, as it can develop quickly.
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).
In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.
Find out more about treating AML
","It's not clear exactly what causes AML and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause.
But some things can increase your risk of getting AML, including:
previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment)
smoking and other exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke
having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome
Find out more about the causes of AML",Severe,Hematologist,Rare,No
10,Acute pancreatitis,Acute pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed (swollen) over a short period of time.,"Treatment for acute pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and manage any symptoms.
This usually involves admission to hospital. You may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenous fluids), pain relief, liquid food through a tube in your tummy and oxygen through tubes in your nose.
Most people with acute pancreatitis get better within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after a few days.
Recovery can take longer in severe cases, as some people can develop complications.
Read more about treating acute pancreatitis and the possible complications of acute pancreatitis.
","Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to:
gallstones 
drinking too much alcohol
But sometimes the cause is not known.
By reducing how much alcohol you drink and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.

11,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening illness that can happen when your lungs are not working properly. ARDS is usually a complication of other serious conditions and is treated in hospital.,"oxygen, which you breathe in using a mask
ventilation, where a machine is used to breathe for you
medicines, such as antibiotics to treat infection
fluids given through a vein
","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually affects people who are already unwell.
Causes of ARDS can include:
sepsis

accidentally inhaling vomit or food
drowning
smoke inhalation
severe injuries
having blood transfusions
having a lung transplant",Severe,Pulmonologist,Common,No
12,Addison's disease,"Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism, is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.","Addison's disease is treated with medicine to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take it for the rest of your life.
With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition have a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life with few limitations.
But many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue, and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis.
This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal.
If you or someone you know has Addison's disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, they will need a hydrocortisone injection immediately, either injected by themselves or by a person who is with them.
Then call 999 for an ambulance, saying it's an ""adrenal crisis"" or ""Addisonian crisis"".
","Addison's disease is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of the steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol.
It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK.
Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK.",Severe,Endocrinologist,Rare,No
13,Adenomyosis,Adenomyosis is a condition where the lining of the womb (uterus) starts growing into the muscle in the wall of the womb. There are treatments that can help with any symptoms.,"the IUS (intrauterine system, also called Mirena or hormonal coil), which thins the womb lining, making your periods lighter and less painful
other types of hormonal contraception if you cannot or do not want to have an IUS, such as the progestogen-only pill, the combined pill or the contraceptive patch
medicines such as tranexamic acid or NSAIDs
","It's not clear what causes adenomyosis.
You may be more likely to get it if you are over the age of 30 and have given birth.

14,Alcohol misuse,"Alcohol misuse is when you drink in a way that's harmful, or when you're dependent on alcohol. To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, both men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week.","counselling – including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
medicines
detoxification – this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms
","To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low:
men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis
if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days
if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week
if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum
Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks.
The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.",Severe,Addiction Specialist,Common,No
15,Alcohol poisoning,Alcohol poisoning can happen when you drink alcohol quicker than your body can process it. It can make you seriously ill and you may need to go to hospital for treatment.,"You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications, like liver and heart failure, which can be fatal.
You may be given fluids, which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off.
","Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking, which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood.
Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening.
Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others, with fewer effects.",Severe,Emergency Medicine Specialist,Rare,No
16,Alcohol-related liver disease,Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.,"There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life.
This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering.
If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult.
But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services.
A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol.
You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking.
All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life.

17,Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis is where your nose gets irritated by something you're allergic to, such as pollen, causing sneezing and other symptoms. For most people it's easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist.","If pharmacy medicines do not help ease your allergic rhinitis symptoms, a GP may prescribe a different medicine, such as prescription steroid nasal sprays or antihistamines.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe.
","Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction.
Common allergies include:
pollen from trees, grass and weeds (hay fever)
house dust mites
animals such as dogs and cats
mould
wood dust, flour dust and latex
You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma.

22,Anal fissure,"An anal fissure is a tear or open sore (ulcer) that develops in the lining of the large intestine, near the anus.","A GP can prescribe medicine to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process.
This can include laxatives to help you poo more easily and painkilling ointment that you put directly on your anus.
Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medicine have not helped.
Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures, but it does carry a small risk of complications, such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence).
Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment.
But they can easily come back if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated.
In some people, symptoms from anal fissures last 6 weeks or more (chronic anal fissures).
","Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal, the last part of the large intestine.
Most cases occur in people who have constipation, when a particularly hard or large poo tears the lining of the anal canal.
Other possible causes of anal fissures include:
persistent diarrhoea
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
pregnancy and childbirth
occasionally, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as syphilis or herpes, which can infect and damage the anal canal
having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles, which can increase the tension in your anal canal, making it more susceptible to tearing

28,Aphasia,"Aphasia is when a person has difficulty with their language or speech. It's usually caused by damage to the left side of the brain (for example, after a stroke).","Speech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia.
This aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate, as well as help you develop alternative ways of communicating, if necessary.
You may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis or in a group, depending on your needs and the service provided.
An increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia.
But it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist.
How successful treatment is differs from person to person. Most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery, and some recover fully.
If the aphasia is caused by a one-off event, like a stroke, most patients recover to some degree with therapy. There's no evidence to suggest that recovery stops at a specific time after stroke.
But the chance of recovery is poorer for people with aphasia resulting from a progressive neurological condition.
Some people can still respond to therapy, but there are currently no good ways of reversing the ongoing injury to the brain.
When aphasia is caused by a progressive condition, treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do and developing other ways of communicating to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult.
Read more about treating aphasia.
","Aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and producing language.
Common causes include:
stroke – the most common cause of aphasia
severe head injury
a brain tumour
progressive neurological conditions – conditions that cause the brain and nervous system to become damaged over time, such as dementia
Aphasia can affect people of all ages, but it's most common in people over the age of 65. This is because strokes and progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults.",Moderate,Speech Therapist,Rare,No

surgery to divert blood around the blocked artery – for example, a coronary artery bypass graft (where a blood vessel taken from another part of the body is used to bypass a blockage in the artery that supplies the heart muscle)
","A blood clot does not usually have any symptoms until it blocks the flow of blood to part of the body.
This can cause several serious problems, including:
a heart attack, when blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, causing chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness
a stroke, when blood flow to the brain is cut off; the main symptoms are one side of the face dropping, weakness in one side of the body and slurred speech
a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ""mini-stroke"", when blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked, causing short-lived stroke symptoms
critical limb ischaemia (a complication of peripheral arterial disease), when the blood supply to a limb is blocked, causing it to become painful, discoloured (either pale or blue) and cold

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) – a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunting – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Untethering – some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine.
Spinal fixation – some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine.
","The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done.
Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain.
Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour.
Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development.

If you have doxycycline, you should not have sex (including oral sex) until you and your current sexual partner have finished treatment.
If you have azithromycin, you should wait 7 days after treatment before having sex (including oral sex).
It's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent sexual partners you have had are also tested and treated to help stop the spread of the infection.
Under-25s who have chlamydia should be offered another test 3 to 6 months after being treated.
This is because young adults who test positive for chlamydia are at increased risk of catching it again.
Sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics can help you contact your sexual partners.

85,Cholesteatoma,A cholesteatoma is an abnormal collection of skin cells deep inside your ear.,"To remove a cholesteatoma, you usually need to have surgery under general anaesthetic.
After the cholesteatoma has been taken out, your ear may be packed with a dressing. This will need to be removed a few weeks later, and you'll be told how to look after it.
As well as removing the cholesteatoma, the surgeon may be able to improve your hearing. This can be done in a number of ways.
For example, a tiny artificial hearing bone (prosthesis) can be inserted to bridge the gap between your eardrum and the cochlea (hearing organ). In some cases, it may not be possible to reconstruct the hearing or a further operation may be needed.
The benefits of removing a cholesteatoma usually far outweigh the complications. However, as with any type of surgery, there's a small risk associated with having anaesthetic, and a very small chance of facial nerve damage resulting in weakness of the side of the face.
Discuss the risks with your surgeon before having the operation.
","A cholesteatoma can develop if part of the eardrum collapses.
Dead skin cells are normally passed out of the ear, but if the eardrum collapses, it may create a pocket where the dead skin cells can collect.

96,Congenital heart disease,Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that affect the normal way the heart works.,"Treatment for congenital heart disease usually depends on the defect you or your child has.
Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, often don't need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems.
Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function.
However, people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time.
Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited and they may need to take extra steps to protect themselves from getting infections.
It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team.

Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
","CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.

topical corticosteroids – ointments and creams containing a steroid that are applied to the skin and may relieve severe symptoms
antihistamines – medicines that can reduce itching
","The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin.
When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin.
It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema.
Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema, which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.
Other possible triggers 
An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn.
Some medicines have been linked to discoid eczema. You should not stop taking any prescribed medicine without talking to the doctor who prescribed it for you.

Double vision affecting both eyes (binocular)
Double vision affecting both eyes is usually a symptom of a squint.
This is where problems with the eye muscles or nerves cause the eyes to look in slightly different directions.
Squints are more common in children but they do not always cause double vision. An untreated squint in children under 7 causes a lazy eye instead.
Squints in adults are sometimes a sign of a more serious condition.
Double vision affecting 1 eye (monocular)

","The ovaries stop working
Early menopause can happen naturally if a woman's ovaries stop making normal levels of certain hormones, particularly the hormone oestrogen.
This is sometimes called premature ovarian failure, or primary ovarian insufficiency.
The cause of premature ovarian failure is often unknown, but in some women it may be caused by:
chromosome abnormalities – such as in women with Turner syndrome
an autoimmune disease – where the immune system starts attacking body tissues
certain infections, such as tuberculosis, malaria and mumps – but this is very rare
Premature ovarian failure can sometimes run in families. This might be the case if any of your relatives went through the menopause at a very young age (20s or early 30s).
Cancer treatments
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause premature ovarian failure. This may be permanent or temporary.
Your risk of having an early menopause will depend on:
your age – girls who have not yet reached puberty can tolerate stronger treatment than older women
the type of treatment you're given – different types of chemotherapy may affect the ovaries differently
where on your body any radiotherapy is focused – your risk of developing premature menopause is higher if you have radiotherapy treatment around your brain or pelvis

","EDS can be inherited, but it happen by chance in someone without a family history of the condition.
The 2 main ways EDS is inherited are:
autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) – the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by 1 parent and there's a 1 in 2 chance of each of their children developing the condition
autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) – the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 1 in 4 chance of each of their children developing the condition
A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children.
For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS cannot inherit vascular EDS.
The severity of the condition can vary within the same family.",Severe,Rheumatologist or Geneticist,Rare,No
134,Embolism,"An embolism is a blocked artery caused by a foreign body, such as a blood clot or an air bubble.","what caused the blockage
the size of the blockage
where the blockage is in the body
","A foreign body is any object or substance which shouldn't be in your blood. Foreign bodies that cause embolisms are known as emboli – a single emboli is called an embolus.
Some common causes of an embolism are outlined below.
Blood clots
Blood contains natural clotting agents which help prevent you bleeding excessively when you cut yourself.
Certain health conditions – such as obesity, heart disease, cancer and pregnancy – can cause blood clots to form inside your veins even where there's no bleeding.
A clot can travel in the bloodstream before it gets stuck and starts to block the blood flow to an organ or a limb.
Fat
A fracture to a long bone, such as a thigh bone, can lead to fat particles within the bone being released into the bloodstream. Fat particles can also sometimes develop following severe burns or as a complication of bone surgery.
Air
Embolisms can also occur if air bubbles or other gases enter the bloodstream.
Air embolisms are a particular concern for scuba divers. If a diver swims to the surface too quickly, the change in pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to form in their bloodstream and become trapped in a blood vessel. This blockage can cause decompression sickness, which is often referred to as ""the bends"".
Cholesterol
In people with severe atherosclerosis (narrowed arteries caused by a build-up of cholesterol), small pieces of cholesterol can sometimes break away from the side of a blood vessel, resulting in an embolism.
Amniotic fluid
In rare cases, amniotic fluid – which surrounds and protects a baby inside the womb – can leak into the mother's blood vessels during labour, causing a blockage. This can lead to breathing problems, a drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.",Severe,Pulmonologist or Vascular Surgeon,Common,No
135,Empyema,Empyema is the medical term for pockets of pus that have collected inside a body cavity.,"Some patients will just need antibiotics given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously).
But they may need to stay in hospital for a long period.
Some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain.
A chest drain is a flexible plastic tube that's inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area to drain it of fluid.
The area where the tube is inserted is numbed, and the patient may also be given a light sedative before having the drain inserted.
Painkillers are given to ease any pain while the chest drain is in.
The chest tube usually stays in place until an X-ray or ultrasound scan shows all the fluid has drained from the chest and the lungs are fully expanded.
Sometimes injections may be given through the chest drain to help clear the infected pockets of pus.
The patient may need to stay in hospital until the tube is removed.
Some patients may be able to go home with the chest tube still in place, in which case a specialist nurse will offer support and advice on how to manage this at home.
The nurse will demonstrate how to position, empty and change the bag until the family or patient feels confident they can do this themselves.
For more information, read this NHS factsheet on chest drains (PDF, 60kb).
Surgery may be needed if the condition doesn't improve. 
This involves making a cut in the chest to access the lungs and removing the thick layer coating the lungs so they can expand properly again.
This is only carried out if other treatments haven't worked.
Your surgeon or specialist will explain the benefits and risks of the procedure.
Find out more about lung surgery
A chest drain isn't suitable for all patients. Some will instead opt to have an opening made in their chest, known as a stoma. 
A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema.
This is worn on the body, and may be more discreet and interfere less with your lifestyle than a chest drain.
But with modern treatments, getting a stoma is uncommon.
","The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura.
These layers are almost in contact, but separated by a thin space (the pleural space) filled with a small amount of lubricant called pleural fluid.
The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected, and a collection of pus forms.
This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together, creating pockets of pus.
Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus, with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs.
These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly.
Pneumonia and other possible causes
The most common cause of empyema is pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs.
An empyema can form when pneumonia fails to fully respond to treatment in a straightforward way.
Other possible causes are:
bronchiectasis – a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection
a blood clot or another blockage – this can prevent blood flow to the lungs, causing some of the lung tissue to die (known as a pulmonary infarction)
surgery to the chest – empyema is a rare complication
an endoscopy – empyema is a rare complication
serious injury to the chest
an infection elsewhere in the body that's spread through the bloodstream
an infection caused by inhaled food if you have swallowing problems – this is rare
tuberculosis – this is rare in the UK

viral infections – very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by the common viruses that causes cold sores (herpes simplex) or chickenpox (herpes varicella) spreading to the brain
a problem with the immune system, the body's defence against infection – sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamed

a throat swab – to test for any bacteria or viruses
blood tests – to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood
an X-ray or a CT scan – sometimes used to check the level of swelling
","Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria.
As well as epiglottitis, Hib can cause a number of serious infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis.
It spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus. The bacteria are in the tiny droplets of saliva and mucus propelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You catch the infection by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have landed on a surface or object, by touching this surface and then touching your face or mouth.
Less common causes of epiglottitis include:
other bacterial infections – such as streptococcus pneumoniae (a common cause of pneumonia)
fungal infections – people with a weakened immune system are most at risk from these types of infection

Interferon has the advantage that it can be taken in pregnancy, but it may cause unpleasant side effects, such as hair loss and flu-like symptoms
","Erythrocytosis can be divided into several different types, depending on the underlying cause. In some cases, an underlying cause can't be identified.
Apparent erythrocytosis
""Apparent erythrocytosis"" is where your red cell count is normal, but you have a reduced amount of a fluid called plasma in your blood, making it thicker.
Apparent erythrocytosis is often caused by being overweight, smoking, drinking too much alcohol or taking certain medicines – including diuretics (tablets for high blood pressure that make you pee more).
Apparent erythrocytosis may improve if the underlying cause is identified and managed. Stopping smoking or reducing your alcohol intake, for example, may help.
Relative polycythaemia
This is similar to apparent erythrocytosis. It can happen as a result of dehydration.
Absolute polycythaemia
""Absolute erythrocytosis"" is where your body produces too many red blood cells. There are 2 main types:
primary erythrocytosis – there's a problem in the cells produced by the bone marrow that become red blood cells; the most common type is known as polycythaemia vera
secondary erythrocytosis – too many red blood cells are produced as the result of an underlying condition
Primary erythrocytosis - polycythaemia vera
Polycythaemia vera is rare. It's usually caused by a change in the JAK2 gene, which causes the bone marrow cells to produce too many red blood cells. It’s a slow-growing type of blood cancer.
The affected bone marrow cells can also develop into other cells found in the blood, which means that people with polycythaemia vera may also have abnormally high numbers of both platelets and white bloods cells.
Although caused by a genetic change, polycythaemia vera isn't usually inherited. Most cases develop later in life. The average age at diagnosis is 60.
Secondary erythrocytosis
Secondary erythrocytosis is where an underlying condition causes more erythropoietin to be produced. This is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the bone marrow cells to produce red blood cells.
Health conditions that can cause secondary erythrocytosis include:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – this can cause an increase in erythropoietin, due to not enough oxygen reaching the body's tissues
a problem with the kidneys – such as a kidney cancer or narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys",Moderate,Hematologist or General Practitioner,Rare,No

If you have another condition that's causing your symptoms, treating that condition can help.
Most treatment aims to prevent flare-ups. It can include medicines, creams, gels, sprays, tablets and medicines given into a vein.
Rarely, you may need surgery.
Erythromelalgia can be difficult to treat. You may need to try different combinations of treatments to find the ones that work for you.
","It's often not clear what causes erythromelalgia.
Sometimes it's caused by another condition or a faulty gene inherited from one of your parents.

","Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:
lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes
white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin
unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing melanoma skin cancer and eye melanoma
use of sunbeds – there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma
overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma

160,Gestational diabetes,Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth.,"If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels.
You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment.
Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before.
However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections.
You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems.
If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time.
Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled.

198,Iron deficiency anaemia,"Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron, often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods.","Once the reason you have anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment.
If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body.
You’ll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron.
Follow the GP’s advice about how to take iron tablets.
Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like:
Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects.
It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects.
Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal.
Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal.
","In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet.
Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine.
For men and for women whose periods have stopped, bleeding in the stomach and intestines is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by:
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin

","The genetic change (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.
A baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father (known as autosomal recessive inheritance). If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of IVA and won't have the condition themselves.
If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:
a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition
a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of IVA
a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes
Although it's not possible to prevent IVA, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.

203,Kidney infection,"A kidney infection is a painful and unpleasant illness usually caused by cystitis, a common infection of the bladder.","Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream.
You may also need painkillers.
If you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection (for example, if you have a long-term health condition or are pregnant), you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through a drip.
Most people who are diagnosed and treated promptly with antibiotics feel completely better after about 2 weeks.
People who are older or have underlying conditions may take longer to recover.
","A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria, often a type called E. coli, get into the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra).
The bacteria travel up to your bladder, causing cystitis, and then up into your kidneys.
E. coli bacteria normally live in your bowel, where they cause no harm.
They can be transferred from your bottom to your genitals during sex or if you're not careful when wiping your bottom after going to the loo.
A kidney infection can sometimes develop without a bladder infection. For example, if you have a problem with your kidney, such as kidney stones, or if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system.
Who's at risk
Kidney infections can happen at any age and are much more common in women.
This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.
Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.",Moderate,Nephrologist or Urologist,Common,No

Do not take them for any longer, as they can slow down your recovery.
Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as a cold or flu, so antibiotics will not help. But a GP may prescribe antibiotics if they think your infection is bacterial.
Sometimes, balance problems can last for much longer – for many months or even years.
Vestibular rehabilitation is a series of exercises that can help restore balance. You should only do the exercises under the supervision of a specialist such as a physiotherapist or audiologist.

plasmapheresis – a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves
immunoglobulin therapy – injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves
","LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves.
Normally, nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles.
If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly.

Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms.
Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream (topical corticosteroids) for a short time.
Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin.
Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis, such as red skin and itchiness.
Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of histamine and are often used to treat allergic conditions.
Read more about treating mastocytosis.
","The cause or causes of mastocytosis are not fully known, but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation.
The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF).
SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells, such as blood cells and mast cells, inside the bone marrow.

","As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body repairs the damage itself and you do not experience any symptoms.
But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become swollen and red. (Redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin.)
The exact cause is not known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including:
joint injury – overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation
other conditions (secondary arthritis) – osteoarthritis can happen in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout
age – your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older
family history – osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies have not identified a single gene responsible
obesity – being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips

surgery – this may be needed if further problems develop, such as fractures, deformities or severe joint damage
","Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin – old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling.
2 cells are responsible for this:
osteoclasts – cells that absorb old bone
osteoblasts – cells that make new bone
In Paget's disease of bone, something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual.
The osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly, but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal.
It's not clear what triggers this, but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition.",Moderate,Rheumatologist or Endocrinologist,Rare,No

It's important to complete the whole course and avoid having sexual intercourse during this time to help ensure the infection clears.
Your recent sexual partners also need to be tested and treated to stop the infection coming back or being spread to others.
","Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that's spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.
Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. In many cases, it's caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea.

For example, if you have diabetes, it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol.
Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers often do not work.
If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually.
For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and walking aids.
","In the UK diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.
Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves.
This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes.
For example, it can be caused by:
physical injury to the nerves

It can be difficult to digest food if you have peritonitis.
A feeding tube might be passed into your stomach through your nose or placed inside your stomach using keyhole surgery.
If a feeding tube cannot be used, liquid nutrients can be given directly into one of your veins.
If part of your stomach lining has been seriously damaged by infection, you may need surgery to remove it.
Sometimes pus-filled swellings (abscesses) develop in the lining and need to be drained with a needle under local anaesthetic.
You might also need an operation to deal with the cause of the peritonitis. For example, a burst appendix will need to be removed.
","The lining of the tummy (peritoneum) covers internal organs like the kidneys, liver and bowel.
If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis, the internal organs it covers can also be damaged.

If fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended.
This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone.
With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.
","The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families.
It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body.

Use a sunscreen that is SPF 50 or above with a UVA rating of 4 or 5 stars. Apply sunscreen thickly and evenly around 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun
Reapply every 2 hours and straight after you've dried yourself off after swimming.
A GP can prescribe corticosteroid (steroid) cream or ointment that's only applied when the rash appears.
You should apply it sparingly, as often as the GP advises. Do not apply it when there's no rash.
It's sometimes possible to increase the resistance of your skin to the sun.
This involves visiting a hospital dermatology department 3 times a week for 4 to 6 weeks in the spring.
Your skin is gradually exposed to a little more UV light every visit to try to build up your skin's resistance.
The effects of desensitisation are lost in the winter, so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.
A GP or dermatologist may advise you to try increasing the resistance of your skin at home.
This is known as ""hardening"" and involves going outside for short periods in the spring to build up your resistance.
You might find the time is as short as a few minutes at first, but you may be able to gradually build up to longer times.
You'll have to be careful not to overdo it but, as you begin to understand more about how much light triggers your rash, you'll be able to judge how long to stay out.
Like desensitisation, the effects of hardening are lost in the winter, so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.

In some cases, procedures may be required to remove blood clots. Surgery may also be needed to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding if this was the cause of your stroke.
","Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly.
If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death.

ischaemic – where the blood supply is stopped because of a blood clot, accounting for 85% of all cases
haemorrhagic – where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts
There's also a related condition called a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where the blood supply to the brain is temporarily interrupted.
This causes what's known as a mini-stroke. It can last a few minutes or persist up to 24 hours.

It's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up to prevent reinfection.
Your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated.
","Trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis.  
In women, this parasite mainly infects the vagina and the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).
In men, the infection most commonly affects the urethra, but the head of the penis or prostate gland – a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen – can become infected in some cases.
The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom.
It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use.
You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.
Trichomoniasis is not thought to be passed on through oral or anal sex.
You also cannot pass on trichomoniasis through:

topical corticosteroids – ointments or creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms
compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that squeeze your legs tightly at the foot and ankle and become looser further up your leg, helping to improve your circulation
","Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in the leg veins.
When small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards.
This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.
Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly.
Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening, including:
sex – varicose eczema is more common in women
obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins
pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins
a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart)
not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins

349,Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that cannot function properly.,"Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.
Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first.
Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections.
Treatments may last until your vitamin B12 levels have improved or you may need treatment for the rest of your life.
Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for 4 months.
In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it coming back.
Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and specially fortified foods.
Good sources of folate include green vegetables, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and peas.
","There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
These include:
pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK
a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can happen if you have a vegan diet and do not take vitamin B12 supplements or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 , follow a restrictive diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time
medicine – certain medicines, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs

350,Vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin.","If vitiligo is severe or making you unhappy, you may want to consider treatment.
The white patches caused by vitiligo are usually permanent, although treatment options are available to reduce their appearance.
If the patches are relatively small, skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up.
Steroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment, however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin
If steroid creams do not work, phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used.
Although treatment may help restore colour to your skin, the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading.
Find out more about treating vitiligo.
","Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.
In vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair.
Autoimmune conditions
Non-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition.
In autoimmune conditions, the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue.
If you have non-segmental vitiligo, your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin.
Vitiligo is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions.
Risk factors
You may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if:
other members of your family have it
there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions – for example, if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach)
you have another autoimmune condition
you have melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system)
you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo
Neurochemicals
Segmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.
Triggers
It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as:
stressful events, such as childbirth
skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response)
hormonal changes to the body, such as puberty
problems with the liver or kidneys
exposure to certain chemicals
Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it.",Mild,Dermatologist or General Practitioner,Common,No

in severe cases, von Willebrand factor concentrate
tell your surgeon or dentist about it if you're due to have a procedure or operation – you may need to take medicine to reduce the risk of bleeding before and afterwards
tell your doctor or nurse about your VWD if you need a vaccination – they can give the injection just under your skin to avoid painful bleeding in your muscles
avoid aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen unless your specialist advises you it's safe to use them, as these can make bleeding worse – use other medicines such as paracetamol instead
ask your specialist if there are any activities you need to avoid – you should be able to take part in most sports and activities, but it's best to check first
","VWD is often caused by a fault in the gene involved in the production of von Willebrand factor.
The type of VWD a person is born with mostly depends on whether they inherit copies of this faulty gene from 1 or both parents.
If a parent has a genetic fault that causes VWD – there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child having type 1 or type 2 VWD, and no chance of them having type 3 VWD.
If both parents have a fault in the VWD gene – there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child being a carrier like their parents and a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of them having type 3 VWD.
The chances of inheriting type 1 VWD can also be affected by other things, including blood group. People with blood group O are more often affected than people with blood group A or B.
This means it's not always easy to predict whether a child might inherit it from their parents.
Parents who are carriers of a faulty VWF gene may not have symptoms themselves.
Speak to your specialist if you have VWD and are thinking about having a baby. If you have a family history of VWD and think you might be affected, you should ideally have tests before you get pregnant.",Severe,Hematologist or Pediatrician,Rare,No

Hospital treatment is usually needed if you have severe whooping cough, or your baby is under 6 months old and has whooping cough.
If whooping cough is diagnosed within 3 weeks of the infection, you'll be given antibiotics to help stop it spreading to others. Antibiotics may not reduce symptoms.

356,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a relatively common heart condition that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast for periods of time.,"Vagal manoeuvres – techniques designed to stimulate the nerve that slows down the electrical signals in your heart. An example is the ""Valsalva manoeuvre"", where you hold your nose, close your mouth and exhale hard while straining as if you're on the toilet.
Medication – an injection of medicine such as adenosine can be given in hospital if vagal manoeuvres don't help. It can block the abnormal electrical signals in your heart.
Cardioversion – a type of electric shock therapy that jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm. This may be carried out in hospital if the above treatments don't work.
Lifestyle changes – if your episodes are triggered by things such as strenuous exercise or alcohol, avoiding these may help. Your cardiologist can advise you about this.
Catheter ablation – this procedure is commonly used nowadays to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system. It's effective in around 95% of cases.
Medication – daily tablets of medication such as amiodarone can help prevent episodes by slowing down the electrical impulses in your heart.
","When the heart beats, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals.
In WPW syndrome, there's an extra electrical connection in the heart, which allows electrical signals to bypass the usual route and form a short circuit. This means the signals travel round and round in a loop, causing episodes where the heart beats very fast.
The extra electrical connection is caused by a strand of heart muscle that grows while the unborn baby is developing in the womb.
It's not clear exactly why this happens. It just seems to occur randomly in some babies, although rare cases have been found to run in families.",Severe,Cardiologist or Electrophysiologist,Rare,No
