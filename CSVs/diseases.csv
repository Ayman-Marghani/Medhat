1,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling in the aorta the artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (abdomen). Most aneurysms do not cause any problems but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture).,"medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger
surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger) is quickly getting bigger or is painful
","An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened.
It's not always clear what causes it but some people have a higher chance of getting one.
Youâ€™re more at risk if you:
are male and aged 65 or over
smoke or used to smoke
have high blood pressure
have high cholesterol
have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm
have coronary or peripheral artery disease (atherosclerosis)
have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
have a condition such as Marfan syndrome
Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection but this is rare.",Severe,Vascular Surgeon,Common,No
2,Achalasia,Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus) which can make it difficult to swallow food and drink.,"There is no cure for achalasia but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier.
Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.
Medicines such as nitrates or nifedipine can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people although they do not work for everyone.
The effect only lasts for a short time so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches but this usually improves over time.
Under a sedative or general anaesthetic a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long thin flexible tube (endoscope). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach.
This improves swallowing for most people but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.
Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture) which may require emergency surgery.
Using an endoscope botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach causing it to relax.
It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.
Under general anaesthetic the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and is called Heller's Myotomy.
It can permanently make swallowing easier.
Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn which can be a side effect of the Heller's Myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this.
In rare cases some people may need an operation to remove part of their oesophagus.
Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely.
It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. Drinking cold water may help relieve this.
You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.
","Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown.
In some people it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells tissue and organs.
In rare cases achalasia may run in families.",Moderate,Gastroenterologist,Rare,No
3,Acne,Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch.,,"Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty but can start at any age.
Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).
This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.
The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.
Other possible causes
Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne it's likely that you'll also have acne.
Hormonal changes such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy can also lead to episodes of acne in women.
There's no evidence that diet poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.",Mild,Dermatologist,Common,No
4,Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma),An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma.,"monitoring the tumour â€“ small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger
brain surgery â€“ surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger
stereotactic radiosurgery â€“ small tumours or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger
",,Moderate,Neurotologist,Rare,No
5,Acromegaly,Acromegaly is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone causing body tissues and bones to grow more quickly.,"reduce growth hormone production to normal levels
relieve the pressure a tumour may be putting on surrounding tissues
treat any hormone deficiencies
improve your symptoms
damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland
leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain
meningitis â€“ although this is rare
a monthly injection of either octreotide lanreotide or pasireotide â€“ this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours
a daily pegvisomant injection â€“ this blocks the effects of growth hormone and can significantly improve symptoms
bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets â€“ these can stop growth hormone being produced but they only work in a small proportion of people
stereotactic radiotherapy â€“ a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you'll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment which can usually be done in one session
conventional radiotherapy â€“ this also uses a beam of radiation to target the adenoma but it's wider and less precise than the one used in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue so it's given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to give your tissues time to heal between treatments
","If you do not get treatment you may be at risk of developing:
type 2 diabetes
high blood pressure (hypertension)
heart disease
disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
arthritis
bowel polyps which can potentially turn into bowel cancer if left untreated
Because of the risk of bowel polyps a procedure known as a colonoscopy might be recommended if you've been diagnosed with acromegaly. Regular colonoscopy screening may also be necessary.",Severe,Endocrinologist,Rare,No
6,Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses),Actinic keratoses (also called solar keratoses) are dry scaly patches of skin that have been damaged by the sun. It's not usually serious but there's a small chance the patches could become skin cancer. Protecting your skin in the sun and watching out for changes can help.,"prescription creams and gels
freezing the patches (cryotherapy) â€“ this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks
surgery to cut out or scrape away the patches â€“ you'll be given a local anaesthetic first so it does not hurt
photodynamic therapy (PDT) where special cream is applied to the patches and a light is shone on them
",,Moderate,Dermatologist,Common,No
7,Acute cholecystitis,Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct.,"not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder
receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration
taking medicine to relieve your pain
open cholecystectomy â€“ where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy
laparoscopic cholecystectomy â€“ keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen
","The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.
Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common and usually less serious type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.
Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder the cystic duct gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge.
Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats and small cholesterol and salt crystals.
The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common but usually more serious than calculous cholecystitis.
The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known but it's usually a complication of a serious illness infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.
A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery serious injuries or burns sepsis severe malnutrition or dehydration.",Moderate,Gastroenterologist,Common,No
8,Acute kidney injury,Acute kidney injury (AKI) is where your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure.,"to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated
antibiotics if you have an infection
to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted)
a urinary catheter a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage
","You're more likely to get AKI if:
you're aged 65 or over
you already have a kidney problem such as chronic kidney disease
you have a long-term disease such as heart failure liver disease or diabetes
you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently
you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this)
you have a severe infection or sepsis
you're taking certain medicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen or blood pressure medicines such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness
you're given aminoglycosides â€“ a type of antibiotic that's usually only given in hospital; these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill",Severe,Nephrologist,Common,No
9,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses quickly and aggressively and usually requires immediate treatment.,"Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible as it can develop quickly.
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).
In some cases intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.
Find out more about treating AML
","It's not clear exactly what causes AML and in most cases there's no identifiable cause.
But some things can increase your risk of getting AML including:
previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment)
smoking and other exposure to benzene a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke
having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome
Find out more about the causes of AML",Severe,Hematologist,Rare,No
10,Acute pancreatitis,Acute pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed (swollen) over a short period of time.,"Treatment for acute pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and manage any symptoms.
This usually involves admission to hospital. You may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenous fluids) pain relief liquid food through a tube in your tummy and oxygen through tubes in your nose.
Most people with acute pancreatitis get better within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after a few days.
Recovery can take longer in severe cases as some people can develop complications.
Read more about treating acute pancreatitis and the possible complications of acute pancreatitis.
","Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to:
gallstones 
drinking too much alcohol
But sometimes the cause is not known.
By reducing how much alcohol you drink and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely you can reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.
Read more about the causes of acute pancreatitis and preventing acute pancreatitis.",Severe,Gastroenterologist,Common,No
11,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening illness that can happen when your lungs are not working properly. ARDS is usually a complication of other serious conditions and is treated in hospital.,"oxygen which you breathe in using a mask
ventilation where a machine is used to breathe for you
medicines such as antibiotics to treat infection
fluids given through a vein
","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually affects people who are already unwell.

having a lung transplant",Severe,Pulmonologist,Common,No
12,Addisons disease,Addison's disease also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.,"Addison's disease is treated with medicine to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take it for the rest of your life.
With treatment symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition have a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life with few limitations.
But many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms called an adrenal crisis.
This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated it can be fatal.
If you or someone you know has Addison's disease and is experiencing severe symptoms they will need a hydrocortisone injection immediately either injected by themselves or by a person who is with them.
Then call 999 for an ambulance saying it's an ""adrenal crisis"" or ""Addisonian crisis"".
","Addison's disease is usually the result of a problem with the immune system which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex) disrupting the production of the steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol.
It's not clear why this happens but it's responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK.
Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands such as tuberculosis (TB) although this is uncommon in the UK.",Severe,Endocrinologist,Rare,No
13,Adenomyosis,Adenomyosis is a condition where the lining of the womb (uterus) starts growing into the muscle in the wall of the womb. There are treatments that can help with any symptoms.,"the IUS (intrauterine system also called Mirena or hormonal coil) which thins the womb lining making your periods lighter and less painful
other types of hormonal contraception if you cannot or do not want to have an IUS such as the progestogen-only pill the combined pill or the contraceptive patch
medicines such as tranexamic acid or NSAIDs
","It's not clear what causes adenomyosis.
You may be more likely to get it if you are over the age of 30 and have given birth.

14,Alcohol misuse,Alcohol misuse is when you drink in a way that's harmful or when you're dependent on alcohol. To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level both men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week.,"counselling â€“ including self-help groups and talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
medicines
detoxification â€“ this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms
","To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low:
men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis
if you drink as much as 14 units a week it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days
if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week
if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum
Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks.
The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.",Severe,Addiction Specialist,Common,No
15,Alcohol poisoning,Alcohol poisoning can happen when you drink alcohol quicker than your body can process it. It can make you seriously ill and you may need to go to hospital for treatment.,"You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications like liver and heart failure which can be fatal.
You may be given fluids which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off.
","Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood.
Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening.
Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others with fewer effects.",Severe,Emergency Medicine Specialist,Rare,No
16,Alcohol-related liver disease,Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.,"There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking preferably for the rest of your life.
This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering.
If a person is dependent on alcohol stopping drinking can be very difficult.
But support advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services.
A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol.
You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking.
All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant and for the rest of their life.

17,Allergic rhinitis,Allergic rhinitis is where your nose gets irritated by something you're allergic to such as pollen causing sneezing and other symptoms. For most people it's easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist.,"If pharmacy medicines do not help ease your allergic rhinitis symptoms a GP may prescribe a different medicine such as prescription steroid nasal sprays or antihistamines.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe.
","Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction.
Common allergies include:
pollen from trees grass and weeds (hay fever)
house dust mites
animals such as dogs and cats
mould
wood dust flour dust and latex
You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma.
Information:
Allergic rhinitis is different from non-allergic rhinitis which is caused by things like having a cold very hot or cold temperatures and humidity.",Mild,Allergist,Common,No
18,Allergies,An allergy is where your body reacts to something that's normally harmless like pollen dust or animal fur. The symptoms can be mild but for some people they can be very serious.,"trying to avoid the thing you're allergic to whenever possible
medicines for mild allergic reactions like antihistamines steroid tablets and steroid creams
emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors such as an EpiPen for severe allergic reactions
desensitisation (immunotherapy) for severe allergic reactions â€“ this involves carefully exposing you to the thing you're allergic to over time so your body gradually gets used to it and does not react so badly (this should only be done by a medical professional)
","Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.
Common allergens include:
tree and grass pollen (hay fever)
house dust mites
foods such as peanuts milk and eggs (food allergy)
animal fur particularly from pets like cats and dogs
insect stings such as bee and wasp stings

19,Altitude sickness,Altitude sickness can happen when you're at a high altitude. It usually gets better in a few days with rest but it can sometimes be life-threatening and need treatment.,"steroid medicine
medicine to lower your blood pressure
oxygen through a mask
","You can get altitude sickness if you're in a place that is at a high altitude (usually more than 2500 metres above sea level).
You're more likely to get it if you travel or climb to a high altitude quickly.
You can get it in places like:
Mount Everest in Nepal

22,Anal fissure,An anal fissure is a tear or open sore (ulcer) that develops in the lining of the large intestine near the anus.,"A GP can prescribe medicine to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process.
This can include laxatives to help you poo more easily and painkilling ointment that you put directly on your anus.
Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medicine have not helped.
Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures but it does carry a small risk of complications such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence).
Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment.
But they can easily come back if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated.
In some people symptoms from anal fissures last 6 weeks or more (chronic anal fissures).
","Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal the last part of the large intestine.
Most cases occur in people who have constipation when a particularly hard or large poo tears the lining of the anal canal.
Other possible causes of anal fissures include:
persistent diarrhoea
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
pregnancy and childbirth
occasionally a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis or herpes which can infect and damage the anal canal
having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles which can increase the tension in your anal canal making it more susceptible to tearing
In many cases no clear cause can be identified.",Mild,Colorectal Surgeon,Common,No
23,Anal fistula,An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the opening of the bottom (anus).,"a fistulotomy â€“ a procedure that involves cutting open the whole length of the fistula so it heals into a flat scar
seton procedures â€“ where a piece of surgical thread called a seton is placed in the fistula and left there for several weeks to help it heal before a further procedure is carried out to treat it
","Most anal fistulas develop after an anal abscess. You can get one if the abscess does not heal properly after the pus has drained away.
Less common causes of anal fistulas include:
Crohn's disease â€“ a long-term condition where the digestive system becomes inflamed
diverticulitis â€“ infection of the small pouches that can stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon)
hidradenitis suppurativa â€“ a long-term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring

28,Aphasia,Aphasia is when a person has difficulty with their language or speech. It's usually caused by damage to the left side of the brain (for example after a stroke).,"Speech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia.
This aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate as well as help you develop alternative ways of communicating if necessary.
You may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis or in a group depending on your needs and the service provided.
An increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia.
But it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist.
How successful treatment is differs from person to person. Most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery and some recover fully.
If the aphasia is caused by a one-off event like a stroke most patients recover to some degree with therapy. There's no evidence to suggest that recovery stops at a specific time after stroke.
But the chance of recovery is poorer for people with aphasia resulting from a progressive neurological condition.
Some people can still respond to therapy but there are currently no good ways of reversing the ongoing injury to the brain.
When aphasia is caused by a progressive condition treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do and developing other ways of communicating to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult.
Read more about treating aphasia.
","Aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and producing language.
Common causes include:
stroke â€“ the most common cause of aphasia
severe head injury
a brain tumour
progressive neurological conditions â€“ conditions that cause the brain and nervous system to become damaged over time such as dementia
Aphasia can affect people of all ages but it's most common in people over the age of 65. This is because strokes and progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults.",Moderate,Speech Therapist,Rare,No
29,Arterial thrombosis,Arterial thrombosis is a blood clot in an artery which can be very serious because it can stop blood reaching important organs.,"injections of a medicine called a thrombolytic which can dissolve some blood clots
an operation to remove the clot (embolectomy)
an operation to widen the affected artery â€“ for example an angioplasty (where a hollow tube is placed inside the artery to hold it open)
surgery to divert blood around the blocked artery â€“ for example a coronary artery bypass graft (where a blood vessel taken from another part of the body is used to bypass a blockage in the artery that supplies the heart muscle)
","A blood clot does not usually have any symptoms until it blocks the flow of blood to part of the body.
This can cause several serious problems including:
a heart attack when blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked causing chest pain shortness of breath and dizziness
a stroke when blood flow to the brain is cut off; the main symptoms are one side of the face dropping weakness in one side of the body and slurred speech
a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ""mini-stroke"" when blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked causing short-lived stroke symptoms
critical limb ischaemia (a complication of peripheral arterial disease) when the blood supply to a limb is blocked causing it to become painful discoloured (either pale or blue) and cold

These are prescribed by a GP or sexual health clinic.
If you have a same-sex partner they may also need treatment.
It's common for bacterial vaginosis to come back usually within a few months. If it comes back you'll usually be given more antibiotics to treat it.
If you keep getting it (you get it more than 4 times in a year) you may be given an antibiotic gel that you put in your vagina. You may need to use this for a few months to help stop bacterial vaginosis coming back.
A GP or sexual health clinic will recommend how long you need to treat it.
They can also help identify if something is triggering your bacterial vaginosis such as sex or your period.
","Bacterial vaginosis is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina.

The bacteria themselves are not harmful but they can produce highly poisonous toxins when deprived of oxygen such as in closed cans or bottles stagnant soil or mud or occasionally the human body.
There are 3 main types of botulism:
food-borne botulism â€“ when someone eats food containing the toxins because it has not been properly canned preserved or cooked
wound botulism â€“ when a wound becomes infected with the bacteria usually as a result of injecting illegal drugs like heroin contaminated with the bacteria into muscle rather than a vein
infant botulism â€“ when a baby swallows a resistant form of the bacteria called a spore in contaminated soil or food such as honey (these spores are harmless to older children and adults because the body develops defences against them from about the age of 1)

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) â€“ a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunting â€“ a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Untethering â€“ some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine.
Spinal fixation â€“ some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and may require surgery to stabilise their spine.
","The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done.
Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain.
Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus) and some types of brain tumour.
Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development.

If you have doxycycline you should not have sex (including oral sex) until you and your current sexual partner have finished treatment.
If you have azithromycin you should wait 7 days after treatment before having sex (including oral sex).
It's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent sexual partners you have had are also tested and treated to help stop the spread of the infection.
Under-25s who have chlamydia should be offered another test 3 to 6 months after being treated.
This is because young adults who test positive for chlamydia are at increased risk of catching it again.
Sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics can help you contact your sexual partners.
Either you or the clinic can speak to them or they can be sent a note advising them to get tested.

85,Cholesteatoma,A cholesteatoma is an abnormal collection of skin cells deep inside your ear.,"To remove a cholesteatoma you usually need to have surgery under general anaesthetic.
After the cholesteatoma has been taken out your ear may be packed with a dressing. This will need to be removed a few weeks later and you'll be told how to look after it.
As well as removing the cholesteatoma the surgeon may be able to improve your hearing. This can be done in a number of ways.
For example a tiny artificial hearing bone (prosthesis) can be inserted to bridge the gap between your eardrum and the cochlea (hearing organ). In some cases it may not be possible to reconstruct the hearing or a further operation may be needed.
The benefits of removing a cholesteatoma usually far outweigh the complications. However as with any type of surgery there's a small risk associated with having anaesthetic and a very small chance of facial nerve damage resulting in weakness of the side of the face.
Discuss the risks with your surgeon before having the operation.
","A cholesteatoma can develop if part of the eardrum collapses.
Dead skin cells are normally passed out of the ear but if the eardrum collapses it may create a pocket where the dead skin cells can collect.

This damages your gut (small intestine) so your body cannot properly take in nutrients.,"There's no cure for coeliac disease but following a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition.
Even if you have mild symptoms changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms.
It's important to ensure that your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced.
An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet.
","Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
In coeliac disease the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them.

Mild defects such as holes in the heart often don't need to be treated as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems.
Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function.
However people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time.
Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited and they may need to take extra steps to protect themselves from getting infections.
It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team.

Double vision affecting both eyes (binocular)
Double vision affecting both eyes is usually a symptom of a squint.
This is where problems with the eye muscles or nerves cause the eyes to look in slightly different directions.
Squints are more common in children but they do not always cause double vision. An untreated squint in children under 7 causes a lazy eye instead.
Squints in adults are sometimes a sign of a more serious condition.

","The ovaries stop working
Early menopause can happen naturally if a woman's ovaries stop making normal levels of certain hormones particularly the hormone oestrogen.

chromosome abnormalities â€“ such as in women with Turner syndrome
an autoimmune disease â€“ where the immune system starts attacking body tissues
certain infections such as tuberculosis malaria and mumps â€“ but this is very rare
Premature ovarian failure can sometimes run in families. This might be the case if any of your relatives went through the menopause at a very young age (20s or early 30s).
Cancer treatments
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause premature ovarian failure. This may be permanent or temporary.
Your risk of having an early menopause will depend on:
your age â€“ girls who have not yet reached puberty can tolerate stronger treatment than older women
the type of treatment you're given â€“ different types of chemotherapy may affect the ovaries differently
where on your body any radiotherapy is focused â€“ your risk of developing premature menopause is higher if you have radiotherapy treatment around your brain or pelvis

Certain health conditions â€“ such as obesity heart disease cancer and pregnancy â€“ can cause blood clots to form inside your veins even where there's no bleeding.
A clot can travel in the bloodstream before it gets stuck and starts to block the blood flow to an organ or a limb.
Fat
A fracture to a long bone such as a thigh bone can lead to fat particles within the bone being released into the bloodstream. Fat particles can also sometimes develop following severe burns or as a complication of bone surgery.
Air
Embolisms can also occur if air bubbles or other gases enter the bloodstream.
Air embolisms are a particular concern for scuba divers. If a diver swims to the surface too quickly the change in pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to form in their bloodstream and become trapped in a blood vessel. This blockage can cause decompression sickness which is often referred to as ""the bends"".
Cholesterol
In people with severe atherosclerosis (narrowed arteries caused by a build-up of cholesterol) small pieces of cholesterol can sometimes break away from the side of a blood vessel resulting in an embolism.
Amniotic fluid
In rare cases amniotic fluid â€“ which surrounds and protects a baby inside the womb â€“ can leak into the mother's blood vessels during labour causing a blockage. This can lead to breathing problems a drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.",Severe,Pulmonologist or Vascular Surgeon,Common,No
135,Empyema,Empyema is the medical term for pockets of pus that have collected inside a body cavity.,"Some patients will just need antibiotics given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously).
But they may need to stay in hospital for a long period.
Some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain.
A chest drain is a flexible plastic tube that's inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area to drain it of fluid.
The area where the tube is inserted is numbed and the patient may also be given a light sedative before having the drain inserted.
Painkillers are given to ease any pain while the chest drain is in.
The chest tube usually stays in place until an X-ray or ultrasound scan shows all the fluid has drained from the chest and the lungs are fully expanded.
Sometimes injections may be given through the chest drain to help clear the infected pockets of pus.
The patient may need to stay in hospital until the tube is removed.
Some patients may be able to go home with the chest tube still in place in which case a specialist nurse will offer support and advice on how to manage this at home.
The nurse will demonstrate how to position empty and change the bag until the family or patient feels confident they can do this themselves.
For more information read this NHS factsheet on chest drains (PDF 60kb).
Surgery may be needed if the condition doesn't improve. 
This involves making a cut in the chest to access the lungs and removing the thick layer coating the lungs so they can expand properly again.
This is only carried out if other treatments haven't worked.
Your surgeon or specialist will explain the benefits and risks of the procedure.

A chest drain isn't suitable for all patients. Some will instead opt to have an opening made in their chest known as a stoma. 
A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema.
This is worn on the body and may be more discreet and interfere less with your lifestyle than a chest drain.
But with modern treatments getting a stoma is uncommon.
","The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura.
These layers are almost in contact but separated by a thin space (the pleural space) filled with a small amount of lubricant called pleural fluid.
The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected and a collection of pus forms.
This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together creating pockets of pus.
Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs.
These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly.
Pneumonia and other possible causes
The most common cause of empyema is pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs.
An empyema can form when pneumonia fails to fully respond to treatment in a straightforward way.
Other possible causes are:
bronchiectasis â€“ a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened leading to a build-up of mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection
a blood clot or another blockage â€“ this can prevent blood flow to the lungs causing some of the lung tissue to die (known as a pulmonary infarction)
surgery to the chest â€“ empyema is a rare complication
an endoscopy â€“ empyema is a rare complication
serious injury to the chest
an infection elsewhere in the body that's spread through the bloodstream
an infection caused by inhaled food if you have swallowing problems â€“ this is rare
tuberculosis â€“ this is rare in the UK

viral infections â€“ very rarely encephalitis may be caused by the common viruses that causes cold sores (herpes simplex) or chickenpox (herpes varicella) spreading to the brain
a problem with the immune system the body's defence against infection â€“ sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain causing it to become inflamed

141,Epiglottitis,Epiglottitis is inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis. It's often caused by an infection but can also sometimes happen as a result of a throat injury.,"a fibreoptic laryngoscopy â€“ a flexible tube with a camera attached to one end (laryngoscope) is used to examine the throat
a throat swab â€“ to test for any bacteria or viruses
blood tests â€“ to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood
an X-ray or a CT scan â€“ sometimes used to check the level of swelling
","Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria.
As well as epiglottitis Hib can cause a number of serious infections such as pneumonia and meningitis.
It spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus. The bacteria are in the tiny droplets of saliva and mucus propelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You catch the infection by breathing in these droplets or if the droplets have landed on a surface or object by touching this surface and then touching your face or mouth.
Less common causes of epiglottitis include:
other bacterial infections â€“ such as streptococcus pneumoniae (a common cause of pneumonia)
fungal infections â€“ people with a weakened immune system are most at risk from these types of infection
viral infections â€“ such as the varicella zoster virus (the virus responsible for chickenpox) and the herpes simplex virus (the virus responsible for cold sores)

a procedure to put a small electrical device inside the body that can help control seizures
a special diet (ketogenic diet) that can help control seizures
","In epilepsy the electrical signals in the brain become scrambled and there are sometimes sudden bursts of electrical activity. This is what causes seizures.
In most cases it's not clear why this happens. It's possible it could be partly caused by your genes affecting how your brain works as around 1 in 3 people with epilepsy have a family member with it.

144,Erythrocytosis,Erythrocytosis sometimes called polycythaemia means having a high concentration of red blood cells in your blood.,"hydroxycarbamide â€“ this medicine is taken as tablets every morning and is generally tolerated well. But you should not take it if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant
interferon â€“ this medicine is given by injection into the abdomen or thigh 1 to 3 times a week. You can inject it yourself at home once you've become familiar with how to do it. Interferon has the advantage that it can be taken in pregnancy but it may cause unpleasant side effects such as hair loss and flu-like symptoms
","Erythrocytosis can be divided into several different types depending on the underlying cause. In some cases an underlying cause can't be identified.
Apparent erythrocytosis
""Apparent erythrocytosis"" is where your red cell count is normal but you have a reduced amount of a fluid called plasma in your blood making it thicker.
Apparent erythrocytosis is often caused by being overweight smoking drinking too much alcohol or taking certain medicines â€“ including diuretics (tablets for high blood pressure that make you pee more).
Apparent erythrocytosis may improve if the underlying cause is identified and managed. Stopping smoking or reducing your alcohol intake for example may help.
Relative polycythaemia
This is similar to apparent erythrocytosis. It can happen as a result of dehydration.
Absolute polycythaemia
""Absolute erythrocytosis"" is where your body produces too many red blood cells. There are 2 main types:
primary erythrocytosis â€“ there's a problem in the cells produced by the bone marrow that become red blood cells; the most common type is known as polycythaemia vera
secondary erythrocytosis â€“ too many red blood cells are produced as the result of an underlying condition
Primary erythrocytosis - polycythaemia vera
Polycythaemia vera is rare. It's usually caused by a change in the JAK2 gene which causes the bone marrow cells to produce too many red blood cells. Itâ€™s a slow-growing type of blood cancer.
The affected bone marrow cells can also develop into other cells found in the blood which means that people with polycythaemia vera may also have abnormally high numbers of both platelets and white bloods cells.
Although caused by a genetic change polycythaemia vera isn't usually inherited. Most cases develop later in life. The average age at diagnosis is 60.
Secondary erythrocytosis
Secondary erythrocytosis is where an underlying condition causes more erythropoietin to be produced. This is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the bone marrow cells to produce red blood cells.
Health conditions that can cause secondary erythrocytosis include:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) â€“ this can cause an increase in erythropoietin due to not enough oxygen reaching the body's tissues
a problem with the kidneys â€“ such as a kidney cancer or narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys",Moderate,Hematologist or General Practitioner,Rare,No
145,Erythromelalgia,Erythromelalgia is a rare condition that causes burning pain redness and hot skin mainly in the feet. It can be constant or come and go but treatment and avoiding triggers can help.,"How erythromelalgia is treated depends on the cause.
If you have another condition that's causing your symptoms treating that condition can help.
Most treatment aims to prevent flare-ups. It can include medicines creams gels sprays tablets and medicines given into a vein.
Rarely you may need surgery.
Erythromelalgia can be difficult to treat. You may need to try different combinations of treatments to find the ones that work for you.
","It's often not clear what causes erythromelalgia.
Sometimes it's caused by another condition or a faulty gene inherited from one of your parents.
A flare-up of your symptoms is triggered by an increase in your body temperature.

","Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
It's not clear exactly why this occurs but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:
lighter eye colour â€“ if you have blue grey or green eyes you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes
white or pale skin â€“ eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin
unusual moles â€“ if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles you're more at risk of developing melanoma skin cancer and eye melanoma
use of sunbeds â€“ there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds for example can increase your risk of eye melanoma
overexposure to sunlight â€“ this increases your risk of skin cancer and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma
The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s.

laser treatment â€“ to open up the blocked drainage tubes or reduce the production of fluid in your eyes
surgery â€“ to improve the drainage of fluid
","Glaucoma can occur for a number of reasons.
Most cases are caused by a build-up of pressure in the eye when fluid is unable to drain properly.
This increase in pressure then damages the nerve that connects the eye to the brain (optic nerve).
It's often unclear why this happens although certain things can increase the risk including:
your age â€“ glaucoma becomes more common as you get older
your ethnicity â€“ people of African Caribbean or Asian origin are at a higher risk
your family history â€“ you're more likely to develop glaucoma if you have a parent or sibling with the condition

","While the cause or causes of idiopathic IH is unknown a number of risk factors have been linked to the condition.
It's a rare condition that mainly affects women in their 20s and 30s. It most often happens in women who have gained weight. The reason for this is unclear.
Other factors that have been linked with idiopathic IH include:
some hormone conditions such as hypoparathyroidism or Addisonâ€™s disease
taking certain medicines including some antibiotics lithium (for mental health problems) and medicines for thyroid problems

198,Iron deficiency anaemia,Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods.,"Once the reason you have anaemia has been found (for example an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment.
If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body.
Youâ€™ll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron.
Follow the GPâ€™s advice about how to take iron tablets.
Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like:
Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects.
It's important to keep taking the tablets even if you get side effects.
Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal.
Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal.
","In pregnancy iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet.
Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine.
For men and for women whose periods have stopped bleeding in the stomach and intestines is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by:
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin
stomach ulcers
inflammation of the bowel or food pipe (oesophagus)

199,Isovaleric acidaemia,"Isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) is a rare but potentially serious inherited condition. It means the body can't process the amino acid leucine (amino acids are ""building blocks"" of protein). This causes a harmful build-up of the substance in the blood and urine.","meat
fish
milk and dairy products
eggs
pulses
nuts
L-carnitine

","The genetic change (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.
A baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition â€“ 1 from their mother and 1 from their father (known as autosomal recessive inheritance). If the baby only receives 1 affected gene they'll just be a carrier of IVA and won't have the condition themselves.
If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier your baby has:
a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition
a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of IVA
a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes
Although it's not possible to prevent IVA it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.

203,Kidney infection,A kidney infection is a painful and unpleasant illness usually caused by cystitis a common infection of the bladder.,"Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream.
You may also need painkillers.
If you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection (for example if you have a long-term health condition or are pregnant) you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through a drip.
Most people who are diagnosed and treated promptly with antibiotics feel completely better after about 2 weeks.
People who are older or have underlying conditions may take longer to recover.
","A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria often a type called E. coli get into the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra).
The bacteria travel up to your bladder causing cystitis and then up into your kidneys.
E. coli bacteria normally live in your bowel where they cause no harm.
They can be transferred from your bottom to your genitals during sex or if you're not careful when wiping your bottom after going to the loo.
A kidney infection can sometimes develop without a bladder infection. For example if you have a problem with your kidney such as kidney stones or if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system.
Who's at risk
Kidney infections can happen at any age and are much more common in women.
This is because a woman's urethra is shorter making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.
Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.",Moderate,Nephrologist or Urologist,Common,No

plasmapheresis â€“ a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves
immunoglobulin therapy â€“ injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves
","LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves.
Normally nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles.
If the nerve endings are damaged the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly.
It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer but can occur in people without cancer.",Severe,Neurologist or Rheumatologist,Rare,No

232,Mastocytosis,Mastocytosis is a rare condition caused by an excess number of mast cells gathering in the body's tissues.,"There's no cure for mastocytosis so the aim of treatment is to try to relieve the symptoms.
Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms.
Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream (topical corticosteroids) for a short time.
Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin.
Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis such as red skin and itchiness.
Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of histamine and are often used to treat allergic conditions.
Read more about treating mastocytosis.
","The cause or causes of mastocytosis are not fully known but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation.
The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF).
SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells such as blood cells and mast cells inside the bone marrow.  
In very few cases of mastocytosis it appears the KIT mutation is passed down through families. However in most cases the mutation happens for no apparent reason.",Severe,Allergist or Hematologist,Rare,No

","As part of normal life your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases your body repairs the damage itself and you do not experience any symptoms.
But in osteoarthritis the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down causing pain swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop and the area can become swollen and red. (Redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin.)
The exact cause is not known but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis including:
joint injury â€“ overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation
other conditions (secondary arthritis) â€“ osteoarthritis can happen in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout
age â€“ your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older

265,Otosclerosis,Otosclerosis is a problem with the bones inside the ear which causes gradual hearing loss. Hearing aids or surgery will usually improve your hearing and total hearing loss is rare.,"The 2 main treatment options for otosclerosis are hearing aids or surgery.
Hearing aids work by making the sounds around you louder. They can help you hear easier but they will not stop your hearing from getting worse.
You may also be offered surgery to remove one of the small bones (the stapes) in your affected ear or ears. If your stapes is removed it will be replaced by a plastic or metal implant. Surgery is usually very successful at improving hearing.
You will usually be referred to an ear nose and throat specialist (ENT) who will help you decide which treatment may be best for you.
","Otosclerosis happens when a tiny bone inside your ear called the stapes joins (fuses) with other parts of the ear and stops you being able to hear properly.

supportive therapies â€“ including physiotherapy occupational therapy and devices such as walking sticks or shoe inserts
surgery â€“ this may be needed if further problems develop such as fractures deformities or severe joint damage
","Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin â€“ old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling.
2 cells are responsible for this:
osteoclasts â€“ cells that absorb old bone
osteoblasts â€“ cells that make new bone
In Paget's disease of bone something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual.
The osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal.
It's not clear what triggers this but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition.",Moderate,Rheumatologist or Endocrinologist,Rare,No
270,Panic disorder,Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder where you regularly have sudden attacks of panic or fear.,"Treatment aims to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease your symptoms.

","Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.
Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.",Severe,Neurologist,Common,No
273,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system which includes the womb fallopian tubes and ovaries.,"If diagnosed at an early stage PID can be treated with a course of antibiotics which usually lasts for 14 days.
You'll be given a mixture of antibiotics to cover the most likely infections and often an injection as well as tablets.
It's important to complete the whole course and avoid having sexual intercourse during this time to help ensure the infection clears.
Your recent sexual partners also need to be tested and treated to stop the infection coming back or being spread to others.
","Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that's spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.
Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. In many cases it's caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea.
Another type of STI called mycoplasma genitalium is thought to be increasingly responsible for cases of PID.
In many other cases it's caused by bacteria that normally live in the vagina.",Severe,Gynecologist or Infectious Disease Specialist,Common,Yes

","PAD is a form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it affects the blood vessels.
It's usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the walls of the leg arteries. The fatty deposits (atheroma) are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances.
The build-up of fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts blood flow to the legs. This process is called atherosclerosis.
There are certain things that can increase your chances of developing PAD and other forms of CVD including:
smoking â€“ the most significant risk factor

279,Peripheral neuropathy,Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities such as the hands feet and arms are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected.,"Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.
Not all of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated.
For example if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level stop smoking and cut down on alcohol.
Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines called neuropathic pain agents as standard painkillers often do not work.
If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy these may need to be treated individually.
For example treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and walking aids.
","In the UK diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.
Over time the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves.
This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes.
For example it can be caused by:
physical injury to the nerves
a viral infection such as shingles
a side effect of certain medicines or drinking too much alcohol
People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed.",Severe,Neurologist,Common,No
280,Peritonitis,Peritonitis is an infection of the inner lining of your tummy. Left untreated it can become life threatening.,"If you're diagnosed with peritonitis you'll need treatment in hospital to get rid of the infection.
Treatment usually involves being given antibiotics into a vein (intravenously).
If you have regular kidney dialysis your doctor might discuss a different way of doing it until the peritonitis has been treated.
It can be difficult to digest food if you have peritonitis.
A feeding tube might be passed into your stomach through your nose or placed inside your stomach using keyhole surgery.
If a feeding tube cannot be used liquid nutrients can be given directly into one of your veins.
If part of your stomach lining has been seriously damaged by infection you may need surgery to remove it.
Sometimes pus-filled swellings (abscesses) develop in the lining and need to be drained with a needle under local anaesthetic.
You might also need an operation to deal with the cause of the peritonitis. For example a burst appendix will need to be removed.
","The lining of the tummy (peritoneum) covers internal organs like the kidneys liver and bowel.
If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis the internal organs it covers can also be damaged.
This most often happens because of things like:
a burst stomach ulcer
a burst appendix
digestive problems such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis
pancreatitis

It can also spread through coughs or sneezes but this is less common.
Your chance of getting polio in the UK is extremely low. This is because most people are fully vaccinated. Polio was eradicated in Europe in 2003.
There's still an extremely small risk of catching it when travelling in a country where polio is still found such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.

290,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work.,"There's no cure for PCOS but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to a GP if you think you may have the condition.
If you have PCOS and you're overweight losing weight and eating a healthy balanced diet can make some symptoms better.
Medicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth irregular periods and fertility problems.
If fertility medicines are not effective a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended.
This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens such as testosterone.
With treatment most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.
","The exact cause of PCOS is unknown but it often runs in families.
It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body including high levels of insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body.
Many women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this.
This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone.
Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces.",Moderate,Gynecologist or Endocrinologist,Common,No

292,Polymorphic light eruption,Polymorphic light eruption is a fairly common skin rash triggered by exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet (UV) light.,"There's no cure for polymorphic light eruption but using sunscreens and careful avoidance of the sun will help you manage the rash.
Avoid the sun particularly between 11am and 3pm when the sun's rays are at their strongest and wear protective clothing when outdoors (unless your doctor has advised you to try hardening your skin).
Introduce your skin to sunlight gradually in the spring.
You may be prescribed sunscreens to help prevent the rash developing.
Use a sunscreen that is SPF 50 or above with a UVA rating of 4 or 5 stars. Apply sunscreen thickly and evenly around 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun
Reapply every 2 hours and straight after you've dried yourself off after swimming.
A GP can prescribe corticosteroid (steroid) cream or ointment that's only applied when the rash appears.
You should apply it sparingly as often as the GP advises. Do not apply it when there's no rash.
It's sometimes possible to increase the resistance of your skin to the sun.
This involves visiting a hospital dermatology department 3 times a week for 4 to 6 weeks in the spring.
Your skin is gradually exposed to a little more UV light every visit to try to build up your skin's resistance.
The effects of desensitisation are lost in the winter so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.
A GP or dermatologist may advise you to try increasing the resistance of your skin at home.
This is known as ""hardening"" and involves going outside for short periods in the spring to build up your resistance.
You might find the time is as short as a few minutes at first but you may be able to gradually build up to longer times.
You'll have to be careful not to overdo it but as you begin to understand more about how much light triggers your rash you'll be able to judge how long to stay out.
Like desensitisation the effects of hardening are lost in the winter so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.
People with polymorphic light eruption are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency as a certain amount of sun exposure is needed to make your own vitamin D.
A GP can advise whether you need treatment with vitamin D supplements.
","Polymorphic light eruption is thought to be caused by UV light altering a substance in the skin which the immune system reacts to resulting in the skin becoming inflamed.
It's not passed down through families but about 1 in 5 people with the condition have an affected relative as it's a fairly common condition.

","The exact cause of post-polio syndrome is unclear. It's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it.
The leading theory is that it's the result of the gradual deterioration of nerve cells in the spinal cord (motor neurones) that were damaged by the polio virus. This would explain why the condition can take years to appear.
Post-polio syndrome isn't contagious. The theory that the polio virus may lie dormant in your body causing post-polio syndrome when it becomes reactivated at a later stage has not been proven.
It's not clear why only some people who have had polio develop post-polio syndrome. However those who had severe polio when they were younger may be more likely to develop the condition.",Severe,Neurologist or Rehabilitation Specialist,Rare,No

300,Primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis),Primary biliary cholangitis (often referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) is a type of liver disease that can get gradually worse over time. Without treatment it may eventually lead to liver failure.,"PBC is a progressive condition which means the damage to the liver can steadily get worse over time.
The rate at which PBC progresses varies between individuals. Sometimes it can take decades.
Without treatment the liver can become so badly damaged that it no longer works properly. This is known as liver failure and can be fatal.
Liver failure can be prevented in the majority of people being treated for PBC with current treatments such as ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid.
Other medicines can help relieve the itchiness associated with PBC. Occasionally if the liver is severely damaged a liver transplant may be needed.

","Bile is a liquid produced inside the liver that's used to help digest fats and remove waste products from the body. It passes out of the liver through small tubes called bile ducts.
In PBC the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakenly attacks the bile ducts.
It's not clear why this happens but it's thought to be caused by a combination of subtle differences in how the immune system works.
The bile ducts become damaged and injured causing bile to build up in the liver. This further damages the liver and may lead to scarring (cirrhosis).",Severe,Gastroenterologist or Hepatologist,Rare,No

At hospital you'll probably be given an injection of anticoagulant medicine before you get any test results.
Anticoagulants stop blood clots getting bigger and prevent new clots forming.
If tests confirm you have a pulmonary embolism you'll continue with anticoagulant injections for at least 5 days.
You'll also need to take anticoagulant tablets for at least 3 months.
You should make a full recovery from a pulmonary embolism if it's spotted and treated early.
","A pulmonary embolism often happens when part of the blood clot dislodges itself from your leg and travels up to your lungs causing a blockage.
There are measures you can take to lower your risk of getting a pulmonary embolism.
If you're being treated in hospital for another condition your medical team should take steps to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis).

Pulmonary hypertension usually gets worse over time. Left untreated it may cause heart failure which can be fatal so it's important treatment is started as soon as possible.
If another condition is causing pulmonary hypertension the underlying condition should be treated first. This can sometimes prevent the pulmonary arteries being permanently damaged.
Treatments for pulmonary hypertension may include anticoagulant medicines to reduce the blood's ability to thicken (clot) and diuretics to remove excess fluid as a result of heart failure.
You may also be offered medicine to widen the blood vessels.
Home oxygen therapy may also be prescribed if the level of oxygen in your blood is low.

Strokes are usually treated with medicine. This includes medicines to prevent and dissolve blood clots reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels.
In some cases procedures may be required to remove blood clots. Surgery may also be needed to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding if this was the cause of your stroke.
","Like all organs the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly.
If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury disability and possibly death.
There are 2 main causes of strokes:
ischaemic â€“ where the blood supply is stopped because of a blood clot accounting for 85% of all cases
haemorrhagic â€“ where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts
There's also a related condition called a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) where the blood supply to the brain is temporarily interrupted.
This causes what's known as a mini-stroke. It can last a few minutes or persist up to 24 hours.
TIAs should be treated urgently as they're often a warning sign you're at risk of having a full stroke in the near future.

334,Transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ""mini stroke"" is caused by a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.","Although the symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resolve in a few minutes or hours you'll need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future.
Treatment will depend on your individual circumstances such as your age and medical history.
You're likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk and be offered medicine to treat the cause of the TIA.
In some cases a surgery called a carotid endarterectomy may be needed to unblock your carotid arteries which are the main blood vessels that supply your brain with blood.
","During a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 1 of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked.
This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that's formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles.
Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA including:
smoking
high blood pressure (hypertension)
obesity
high cholesterol levels
regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol
having a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation
having diabetes
People over 55 years of age and people of Asian African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA.",Severe,Neurologist or Vascular Surgeon,Common,No
335,Trichomoniasis,Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).,"Trichomoniasis is unlikely to go away without treatment but it can be effectively treated with antibiotics.
Most men and women are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole which is usually taken twice a day for 5 to 7 days.
It's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up to prevent reinfection.
Your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated.
","Trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis.  
In women this parasite mainly infects the vagina and the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).
In men the infection most commonly affects the urethra but the head of the penis or prostate gland â€“ a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen â€“ can become infected in some cases.
The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom.
It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use.
You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.
Trichomoniasis is not thought to be passed on through oral or anal sex.
You also cannot pass on trichomoniasis through:
kissing or hugging
sharing cups plates or cutlery
toilet seats
The best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to have safe sex. This means always using a condom when having sex covering any sex toys you use with a condom and washing sex toys after use.",Moderate,Gynecologist or Urologist,Common,Yes

","In trimethylaminuria the body is unable to turn a strong-smelling chemical called trimethylamine â€“ produced in the gut when bacteria break down certain foods â€“ into a different chemical that doesn't smell.
This means trimethylamine builds up in the body and gets into bodily fluids like sweat.
In some cases this is caused by a faulty gene a person has inherited from their parents.",Mild,Geneticist or Metabolic Specialist,Rare,No
337,Tuberculosis (TB),Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection that usually affects the lungs. It can be treated with antibiotics but can be serious if not treated. There's a vaccine that helps protect some people who are at risk from TB.,"The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months.
If TB has spread to your brain spinal cord or the area around your heart you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks.
If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months.
It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early TB could come back.
","Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB).
When someone with active TB coughs they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time.
Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others but it can turn into active TB in the future.
People who are more likely to get TB
Anyone can get TB but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it including people who:

338,Typhoid fever,Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body affecting many organs. Without prompt treatment it can cause serious complications and can be fatal.,"Typhoid fever requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.
If typhoid fever is diagnosed early the infection is likely to be mild and can usually be treated at home with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotic tablets.
More severe typhoid fever usually requires admission to hospital so antibiotic injections can be given.
With prompt antibiotic treatment most people will start to feel better within a few days and serious complications are very rare.
Deaths from typhoid fever are now virtually unheard of in the UK.
If typhoid fever isn't treated it's estimated that up to 1 in 5 people with the condition will die.
Some of those who survive will have complications caused by the infection.

Antibiotics are used to treat a typhus infection. They're usually started before you get your test result as this can take up to a week.
Most people start to feel better within 48 hours of starting treatment. It's important to keep taking your antibiotics until they're finished even if you feel better.
People with severe typhus may need to be treated in hospital.
","You can catch typhus if you're bitten by infected lice mites or fleas. These are often found on small animals like mice rats cats dogs and squirrels.
People can also carry them on their clothes skin or hair.

","Ulcerative colitis is thought to be an autoimmune condition.
This means the immune system the body's defence against infection goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue.
The most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon as a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon causing it to become inflamed.
Exactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear.
Many experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",Severe,Gastroenterologist or Colorectal Surgeon,Common,No
341,Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism),An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones.,"Treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine to raise your thyroxine levels.
You'll initially have regular blood tests until the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached. This can take a little while to get right.
Once you're taking the correct dose you'll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.
You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However with proper treatment you should be able to lead a normal healthy life.
If an underactive thyroid is not treated it can lead to complications including heart disease goitre pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare).

342,Urethritis,Urethritis is when the tube that carries pee from the bladder out of the body (urethra) becomes swollen and sore. It's often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people.,"Urethritis is usually treated with antibiotics. It may take a week or two for your symptoms to disappear completely.
Any current sexual partners may also need treatment.
Avoid having sex (including oral sex) until you and any sexual partners have finished treatment and the symptoms have gone.
You may be asked to come back for another appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to check the treatment has worked.
","Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia.
You can get it if you have unprotected sex (without a condom) with someone who has the infection.
Rarely it can be caused by damaging the urethra (for example from a urinary catheter).
Sometimes no cause for the urethritis can be found.",Moderate,Urologist or Infectious Disease Specialist,Common,Yes
343,Urinary tract infections (UTIs),Urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect your urinary tract including your bladder (cystitis) urethra (urethritis) or kidneys (kidney infection). UTIs may be treated with antibiotics but they're not always needed.,"offer self-care advice and recommend taking a painkiller

","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract.
The bacteria enter through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).
Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection.
Things that increase the risk of bacteria getting into the bladder include:
having sex
pregnancy
conditions that block the urinary tract â€“ such as kidney stones
conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder â€“ such as an â€¯enlarged prostate in men and constipation in children
urinary cathetersâ€¯(a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)

injections tablets and capsules are usually used to treat uveitis that affects the middle and back of the eye
","Many cases of uveitis are linked to a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection). For unknown reasons the immune system can become overactive in the eye.
Less often uveitis can be caused by an infection or an eye injury and it can also happen after eye surgery.
In some cases a cause cannot be identified.

347,Varicose eczema,Varicose eczema also known as venous gravitational or stasis eczema is a long-term skin condition that affects the lower legs. It's common in people with varicose veins.,"self-help measures â€“ including ways to improve your circulation such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs
emollients â€“ moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it from becoming dry
topical corticosteroids â€“ ointments or creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms
compression stockings â€“ specially designed stockings usually worn every day that squeeze your legs tightly at the foot and ankle and become looser further up your leg helping to improve your circulation
","Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in the leg veins.
When small valves in the veins stop working properly it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards.
This increases the pressure in the veins which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.
Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly.
Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening including:
sex â€“ varicose eczema is more common in women
obesity â€“ this can increase the pressure in your leg veins
pregnancy â€“ this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins
a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart)
not being able to move for a long period of time â€“ this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins
having previously had DVT (deep vein thrombosis) â€“ blood clots that develop in leg veins which can damage the valves in your veins
increasing age â€“ people generally find it harder to move about as they get older which can affect their circulation",Mild,Dermatologist or Vascular Surgeon,Rare,No
348,Vascular dementia,Vascular dementia is a common type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. It's estimated to affect around 180000 people in the UK.,"eating a healthy balanced diet
losing weight if you're overweight
stopping smoking
getting fit
cutting down on alcohol
taking medicines such as those used to treat high blood pressure lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots
","Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain which damages and eventually kills brain cells. 
This can happen as a result of:
narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels inside the brain
a single stroke where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off
lots of ""mini strokes"" (also called transient ischaemic attacks or TIAs) that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain
In many cases these problems are linked to underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes and lifestyle factors such as smoking and being overweight.
Tackling these might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced.",Severe,Neurologist or Geriatrician,Common,No
349,Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that cannot function properly.,"Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.
Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first.
Then depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections.
Treatments may last until your vitamin B12 levels have improved or you may need treatment for the rest of your life.
Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for 4 months.
In some cases improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it coming back.
Vitamin B12 is found in meat fish eggs dairy products and specially fortified foods.
Good sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli brussels sprouts and peas.
","There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
These include:
pernicious anaemia â€“ where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach preventing your body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK
a lack of these vitamins in your diet â€“ this is uncommon but can happen if you have a vegan diet and do not take vitamin B12 supplements or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12  follow a restrictive diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time
medicine â€“ certain medicines including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs
Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74.",Mild,Hematologist or General Practitioner,Common,No
350,Vitiligo,Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin which is the pigment in skin.,"If vitiligo is severe or making you unhappy you may want to consider treatment.
The white patches caused by vitiligo are usually permanent although treatment options are available to reduce their appearance.
If the patches are relatively small skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up.
Steroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin
If steroid creams do not work phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used.
Although treatment may help restore colour to your skin the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading.
Find out more about treating vitiligo.
","Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes and it gives your skin its colour.
In vitiligo there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair.
Autoimmune conditions
Non-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition.
In autoimmune conditions the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells such as viruses your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue.
If you have non-segmental vitiligo your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin.
Vitiligo is also associated with other autoimmune conditions such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions.
Risk factors
You may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if:
other members of your family have it
there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions â€“ for example if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach)
you have another autoimmune condition
you have melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system)
you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo
Neurochemicals
Segmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.
Triggers
It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events such as:
stressful events such as childbirth
skin damage such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response)
hormonal changes to the body such as puberty
problems with the liver or kidneys
exposure to certain chemicals
Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it.",Mild,Dermatologist or General Practitioner,Common,No

tranexamic acid tablets
desmopressin nasal spray
in severe cases von Willebrand factor concentrate
tell your surgeon or dentist about it if you're due to have a procedure or operation â€“ you may need to take medicine to reduce the risk of bleeding before and afterwards
tell your doctor or nurse about your VWD if you need a vaccination â€“ they can give the injection just under your skin to avoid painful bleeding in your muscles
avoid aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen unless your specialist advises you it's safe to use them as these can make bleeding worse â€“ use other medicines such as paracetamol instead
ask your specialist if there are any activities you need to avoid â€“ you should be able to take part in most sports and activities but it's best to check first
","VWD is often caused by a fault in the gene involved in the production of von Willebrand factor.
The type of VWD a person is born with mostly depends on whether they inherit copies of this faulty gene from 1 or both parents.
If a parent has a genetic fault that causes VWD â€“ there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child having type 1 or type 2 VWD and no chance of them having type 3 VWD.
If both parents have a fault in the VWD gene â€“ there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child being a carrier like their parents and a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of them having type 3 VWD.
The chances of inheriting type 1 VWD can also be affected by other things including blood group. People with blood group O are more often affected than people with blood group A or B.
This means it's not always easy to predict whether a child might inherit it from their parents.
Parents who are carriers of a faulty VWF gene may not have symptoms themselves.
Speak to your specialist if you have VWD and are thinking about having a baby. If you have a family history of VWD and think you might be affected you should ideally have tests before you get pregnant.",Severe,Hematologist or Pediatrician,Rare,No
352,Vulval cancer,Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women.,"The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.
Some people may also have radiotherapy where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells or chemotherapy where medicine is used to kill cancer cells or both.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you're not well enough to have an operation or if the cancer has spread and it's not possible to remove it all.
","The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors:
increasing age
vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) â€“ where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous
persistent infection with certain versions of the human papillomavirus (HPV)

356,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a relatively common heart condition that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast for periods of time.,"Vagal manoeuvres â€“ techniques designed to stimulate the nerve that slows down the electrical signals in your heart. An example is the ""Valsalva manoeuvre"" where you hold your nose close your mouth and exhale hard while straining as if you're on the toilet.
Medication â€“ an injection of medicine such as adenosine can be given in hospital if vagal manoeuvres don't help. It can block the abnormal electrical signals in your heart.
Cardioversion â€“ a type of electric shock therapy that jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm. This may be carried out in hospital if the above treatments don't work.
Lifestyle changes â€“ if your episodes are triggered by things such as strenuous exercise or alcohol avoiding these may help. Your cardiologist can advise you about this.
Catheter ablation â€“ this procedure is commonly used nowadays to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system. It's effective in around 95% of cases.
Medication â€“ daily tablets of medication such as amiodarone can help prevent episodes by slowing down the electrical impulses in your heart.
","When the heart beats its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals.
In WPW syndrome there's an extra electrical connection in the heart which allows electrical signals to bypass the usual route and form a short circuit. This means the signals travel round and round in a loop causing episodes where the heart beats very fast.
The extra electrical connection is caused by a strand of heart muscle that grows while the unborn baby is developing in the womb.
It's not clear exactly why this happens. It just seems to occur randomly in some babies although rare cases have been found to run in families.",Severe,Cardiologist or Electrophysiologist,Rare,No
